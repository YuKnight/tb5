As of version 5.1.9, when you navigate to a missing tiddler this message is shown:

> Missing tiddler "foo" - click {{$:/core/images/edit-button}} to create.

While this can be useful for editing a wiki, it is not so much for visiting a published wiki. To modify this message, you can edit the following tiddler, as is done here:

 <<source [[$:/language/MissingTiddler/Hint]]>>

On tb5, [[another template|$:/.tb/ui/ViewTemplate/redirected-tb5]] already shows links for [[redirected tiddlers|Aliases And Redirecting Dead Links]], so in the above:

* the reveal widget only shows its content when no redirects are defined
** see [[Aliases And Redirecting Dead Links]]
* only then a note is displayed with a button that looks like a link which...
** closes the current tiddler
** navigates to the [[Welcome]] tiddler

> {{this missing tiddler||$:/.tb/ui/ViewTemplate/missing}}
